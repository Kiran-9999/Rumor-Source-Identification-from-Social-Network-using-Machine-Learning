# Rumor-Source-Identification-from-Social-Network-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on identifying the source of rumors in social networks using a hybrid machine learning and deep learning approach. It combines Random Forest, LSTM, and BERT models along with techniques like text mining, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to detect misinformation and trace it back to its origin.
